# Linking specimen with material citation and vice versa 

## Partners
- Plazi (lead) @Donat Agosti

- [Berner Fachhochschule (BFH)](https://www.bfh.ch/en/)
- MBG
- GBIF
- BGBM - Botanischer Garten Berlin?: Especially Natural History collections that issue persistent identifiers for specimens, and in the better case, have a corpus of publications that already make use of this.

## Infrastructures to be used 

## Rationale

Material citations are citations of physical specimens, observations or groups thereof in taxonomic treatments in scholarly publications. Though these are citations, these are based on implicit links. To create a knowledge graph, these links have to be explicit. Similarly, to understand what is known about a specimen, a link needs to be made from the specimen to its material citations and the inclosing treatment and publication. If possible, these links will be complemented by persistent identifiers for treatments, material citations and specimens. 

## Methodology
A test corpus of specimen data and treatments and material citations from publications where they are cited will be prepared and their fields matched or based on the Darwin Core vocabulary. This will allow testing the algorithms, to develop an optimal way to find the complements, and get some matching statistics.
Options will be explored using the data provided by a specimen or material citation, or to find and use specimen codes to link.
Solutions to annotate the specimens and the material citations with the respective identifiers will be explored.

A curation interface will be described and developed.

A user interface for curation will be designed to get data curators involved to optimize for use.

## Outputs
- algorithms that allow finding the respective representations in either database
- a demonstration system allowing annotating the specimen and material citations with the respective identifiers
- A test user Interface that facilitates human interactions to curate links created by automation or create links that have not been discovered.
