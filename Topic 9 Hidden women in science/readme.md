# Hidden women in science

## Partners
- MBG (lead) @Maarten Trekels
- Wikidata
- Plazi
- GBIF
- CETAF
- Science stories

## Infrastructures to be used 
- Wikidata
- Wikipedia
- sciencestories.io
- Bionomia
- BHL
- GBIF
  
## Rationale
Due to various sociological and historical reasons, great achievements of women in science often disappear under the radar. In order to make sure that the attribution of these achievements is correctly associated with the scientists. It is essential to make sure that women are equally represented in the infrastructures and that their works are correctly linked to the right person. Especially the large infrastructures have a big responsibility to represent the reality in a correct way.

## Methodology
Suggestions on how we can proceed with this:
- adding articles on Wikipedia / **Wikidata** → creating Science Stories (sciencestories.io). Can we add other data in a story? Extent the story?
- Work on bionomia / disambiguation
- text mining / computer vision on documents (BHL, treatments…)?
- clustering on **GBIF** data?
  
## Outputs
Possible outcomes:
- defining a workflow
- adding functionality to a specific tool
- recommendations
