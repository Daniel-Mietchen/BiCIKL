# Topics for the BiCIKL Hackathon 2021

The BiCIKL BioHackathon will take place on September 20-24, 2021 at Meise Botanic Garden. This hackathon is a five-day coding event and is held to test and identify barriers to interoperability between the infrastructures. In BiCIKL we want to link up different data types such as specimens, taxon names, literature and sequences (see diagram below). The BioHackathon will explore what the technical issues and requirements are for linking data types in the different infrastructures. 

All BiCIKL partners are invited to propose topics which will then be reviewed in the week of June 28-July 2 by partners involved in Task 1.2. Please add your ideas for topics with a short description in this document by the end of this week. Please describe clearly which infrastructures would be involved and how the hackathon could contribute in making the infrastructures more interoperable.
