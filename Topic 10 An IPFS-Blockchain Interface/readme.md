## Infrastructures to be used 

## Rationale

LifeWatch ERIC is currently developing Lifeblock for ecosystem data management. LifeBlock technology will allow data management from multiple data sources with traceability characteristics, provenance and application of FAIR principles. The management of these data at the time they have been obtained for their application to publications, algorithm management, VREs or other types of research projects, often has the disadvantage of the state of the data at the time they were acquired and its later evolution. Many times the inevitable updating of data sources makes it very complex to justify the results of many of the studies carried out, given that the results may vary as a result of data update in the source. LifeBlock infrastructure has mechanisms based on blockchain and IPFS for better management and future storage of data, as well as the incorporation of a tokenization system, which allows the incorporation of new data sources and the management of their traceability and provenance using the general principles of DLTs architectures regarding the maintenance and preservation of information. The objective of LifeWatch ERIC for this hackathon would be to be able to verify the operation of this system against data sources such as GBIF, CETAF, Plazi, etc., which are present in the BiCIKL project and in this way to be able to provide to these data sources and to the community in general a tool that can be used to carry out the traceability and provenance of the data that may be used in any investigation.

## Methodology
Our objective will be to launch LifeBlock using the APIs of data sources such as GBIF, CETAF, Plazi, etc., and determine the operation of the system and the usefulness that the methodology used by LifeBlock may have in the future for these data sources, trying to understand the necessary variations or the particularities of each of the information sources when managing and processing their data by LifeBlock.

## Outputs
The expected outputs on our part would be:

- Refine the LifeBlock data provenance and traceability system by better understanding the characteristics of each of the data sources.
- Provide a tool to the community and to these databases in particular to carry out the traceability and provenance of the data used in the investigations.
- Demonstrate the usefulness of distributed technologies for use in ecosystem data management.
